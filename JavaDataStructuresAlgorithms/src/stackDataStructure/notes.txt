// THE STACK DATA STRUCTURE //

STACK
	- A bunch of things piled up on top of each other
	- The last item inserted into it, is the first one to be removed
	- ex) Old mail is buried down at the bottom of the stack
	- This is referred to as LIFO 

LIFO (Last In First Out)
	- Placing an item at the top of the stack is called PUSHING it
	- Removing an item from the top of the stack is called POPPING it
	- PUSH and POP are the primary operations of a stack data structure

(create Stack class)
(create Application class)

*** Stack may throw exceptions
	- If we create a stack with a max size of 10 and & we push 11 elements ===> array out of bounds exception!
	- Implement a solution
